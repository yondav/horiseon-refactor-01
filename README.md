The assignment at hand was to assess the existing html and CSS for Horiseon's website in an effort to clean the code for readability and accessibility.

In doing so, I was able to accomplish a complete refactoring of the existing html with semantic tags throughout the website in place of the existing div tags, furthering the SEO if the company's webpage and offering a more clear and concise html file to future developers who may be tasked to make edits and/or updates. I also added the proper attributes throughout the html file to ensure accessibility.

Subsequently I was able to consolidate the linked CSS stylesheet to offer ease for future edits and updates while maintaining the exact appearance and functionality of the original website.

### Please follow these steps to navigate the repository
- Ensure you are on the main branch
- Open index.html to access the html file
- Nested in the assets folder, you will find two folders titled css and images
- You can access the CSS stylesheet by opening the css folder and selecting style.css
- You can access all of the images used throughout the webpage by opening the images folder

I enjoyed this project because it allowed me to further my understanding of semantic html, benefitting Horiseon's over all SEO performance. I also enjoyed adding the proper attributes to ensure accessibility throughout the page. The finished product may not offer any new or improved stylings but overall I believe that the code in both the html file and the CSS file are cleaner and easier to navigate than they were when I was first given the assignment.
