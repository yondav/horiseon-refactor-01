The assignment at hand was to assess the existing html and CSS for Horiseon's website in an effort to clean the code for readability and accessibility.

In doing so, I was able to accomplish a complete refactoring of the existing html with semantic tags throughout the website in place of the existing div tags, furthering the SEO if the company's webpage and offering a more clear and concise html file to future developers who may be tasked to make edits and/or updates. I also added the proper attributes throughout the html file to ensure accessibility.

Subsequently I was able to consolidate the linked CSS stylesheet to offer ease for future edits and updates while maintaining the exact appearance and functionality of the original website.

After the refactor, lighthouse reports that the SEO performance and Best Practices are perfect while Accessibility is just below because the contrast ratio isn't high enough. If I had more freedom to style the website in the assignment, I'd have increased the contrast to ensure the content is easy to read and further increasing the accessibility.

### Please follow these steps to navigate the repository
- Ensure you are on the main branch
- Open index.html to access the html file
- Nested in the assets folder, you will find two folders titled css and images
- You can access the CSS stylesheet by opening the css folder and selecting style.css
- You can access all of the images used throughout the webpage by opening the images folder

I enjoyed this project because it allowed me to further my understanding of semantic html, benefitting Horiseon's over all SEO performance. I also enjoyed adding the proper attributes to ensure accessibility throughout the page. The finished product may not offer any new or improved stylings but overall I believe that the code in both the html file and the CSS file are cleaner and easier to navigate than they were when I was first given the assignment.
